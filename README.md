Context:

Humans in the Loop is publishing an open access dataset annotated for a joint project with the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center in Dubai, the              UAE.

Content:


The dataset consists of aerial imagery of Dubai obtained by MBRSC satellites and annotated with pixel-wise semantic segmentation in 6 classes.              The total volume of the dataset is 72 images grouped into 6 larger tiles. The classes are:

           Building: #3C1098
           Land (unpaved area): #8429F6
           Road: #6EC1E4
           Vegetation: #FEDD3A
           Water: #E2A929
           Unlabeled: #9B9B9B
